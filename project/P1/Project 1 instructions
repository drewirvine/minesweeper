Specific Solution

Start at 0 
Use the 4 unit rod to measure 4 to the right
Mark the position 4
Use the 9 unit rod to measure 9 to the right from the position marked in 3
Mark the position 13
Use the 4 unit rod to measure 4 to the left from the position marked in 5
Mark the position 9
Use the 4 unit rod to measure 4 to the left from the position marked in 7
Mark the position 5
Use the 9 unit rod to measure 9 to the right from the position marked in 9
Mark the position 14
Use the 4 unit rod to measure 4 to the left from the position marked in 11
Mark the position 10
Use the 4 unit rod to measure 9 to the right from the position marked in 15
Mark the position 6
Use the 9 unit rod to measure 9 to the right from the position marked in 17
Mark the position 15
Use the 4 unit rod to measure 4 to the left from the position in 19
Mark the position 11
Use the 4 unit rod to measure 4 to the left from the position in 21
Mark the position 7
End measuring. 

General Solution

Longer rod = m
shorter rod = n
If either rod (m or n) = 1, you don't need this algorithm 
Start at 0
Use rod n to measure to the right
Mark the position and check for 7
Use rod m to measure to the right from the position marked in prior step
Mark the position and check for 7
Use rod n to measure to the left from the position marked in prior step
Mark the position and check for 7
Use rod n to measure to the left from the position marked in prior step
Mark the position and check for 7
Repeat steps (34-39) until you reach desired length of 7
